This repository contains code and analysis from my Microeconomics of Development project at UChicago, exploring why institutional deliveries in rural Bihar remain low. It focuses on information frictions, trust deficits, and the role of media, education, and health system confidence.
Information Frictions and Institutional Delivery: Evidence from Rural Bihar

This repository contains code, data analysis, and policy insights from my research project for ECMA 35530: Microeconomics of Development at the University of Chicago. The project investigates why institutional delivery rates in rural Bihar remain low despite the availability of maternal healthcare services, focusing on information frictions and trust deficits.

Project Overview

Despite improvements in national maternal health, rural Bihar lags behind, with over half of women still delivering at home (IHDS-II, 2011–12). This project explores structural barriers—specifically information gaps, low health literacy, and trust deficits in public healthcare—that prevent rural women from accessing institutional delivery services.

Dataset

Data Source: Indian Human Development Survey-II (IHDS-II), 2011–12
Modules Used:
Individual Questionnaire
Eligible Women Questionnaire
Birth History Module
Household Module
Sample Focus: Rural women in Bihar with recent childbirths
Methodology

Binary logistic regression models were used to estimate the effect of antenatal care (ANC) visits, media exposure, education, age, and confidence in public health services on institutional delivery.
Heterogeneity analysis was performed across:
Educational strata (≥10 years vs. <10 years)
Income groups (above vs. below median per capita income)
Scheduled Caste (SC) subgroup
A robustness check using Firth logistic regression was applied to correct for separation bias in rare outcome cases.
Key Findings

Education: Strongest predictor of institutional delivery.
Media Exposure: Especially effective among uneducated women, acting as a substitute for formal education.
Trust in Public Health: Statistically significant and consistent across all groups.
ANC Visits: Weak standalone predictor unless paired with health literacy.
Income: Poorer women face compounded informational and access constraints.
olicy Recommendations

ASHA + Nudge Program: Deploy community health workers with visual aids and behavioral nudges for undereducated women.
Targeted Media Campaigns: Localized radio/TV messaging for uneducated households.
Trust-Building Recognition: Publicly rank and celebrate well-performing Primary Health Centers (PHCs) to signal credibility and drive uptake.


Limitations

Self-reported data with potential recall bias
Dataset is from 2011–12 and may not reflect post-2015 policy shifts (e.g., Ayushman Bharat)
Findings limited in generalizability beyond rural Bihar
